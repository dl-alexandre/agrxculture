# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current project into a professional portfolio website that showcases coding expertise specifically for the agricultural industry, specializing in IoT-driven farm efficiency and precision agriculture solutions. The website will serve as a marketing platform to attract agricultural clients seeking custom technology solutions for small to medium-sized farming operations (family farms, agricultural cooperatives, and mid-scale commercial operations). The site will include sections for about information, service offerings, project showcases, and client outreach functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Developer Expertise & Background

**User Story:** As a potential agricultural client, I want to learn about the developer's background and expertise, so that I can assess their suitability for my agricultural technology needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses the website THEN the system SHALL display an about section with developer background, agricultural experience, and technical skills
2. WHEN a visitor views the about section THEN the system SHALL highlight high-impact agricultural technologies with use cases (IoT sensors for soil moisture monitoring, precision agriculture for yield optimization, farm management systems for operational efficiency)
3. WHEN a visitor navigates the site THEN the system SHALL use an agricultural color palette (earth tones, greens) with WCAG AA contrast ratios and agricultural imagery with descriptive alt text
4. IF the visitor is on mobile (viewport < 768px) THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout with touch-friendly navigation

### Requirement 2: Project Showcase & Portfolio

**User Story:** As a potential client, I want to see examples of agricultural coding projects, so that I can evaluate the developer's relevant experience and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses the showcase section THEN the system SHALL display at least 3 agricultural technology project examples with images
2. WHEN a visitor views a project THEN the system SHALL show project title, 2-3 sentence description, technologies used (Python, Swift, etc.), and verifiable quantifiable outcomes with specific examples (e.g., "reduced water consumption by 15%", "increased crop yield by 10% in first season")
3. WHEN a visitor clicks on a project card THEN the system SHALL expand to show detailed case study following consistent template: problem → solution → outcome with specific results (e.g., "reduced labor by 20%")
4. IF projects have live demos or GitHub repositories THEN the system SHALL provide working links that open in new tabs

### Requirement 3: Service Offerings & Capabilities

**User Story:** As a potential client, I want to understand what services are offered, so that I can determine if the developer can meet my specific agricultural technology needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses the services section THEN the system SHALL display 3-5 unique service categories as cards with icons (custom IoT integrations for small farms, mobile farm management apps, agricultural data analytics, precision agriculture APIs, farm automation systems)
2. WHEN a visitor views services THEN the system SHALL list specific agricultural applications (farm management systems, crop monitoring, livestock tracking)
3. WHEN a visitor reviews services THEN the system SHALL specify technologies used (Swift, Python, JavaScript, SQL, REST APIs) and link to relevant showcased projects
4. IF consultation services are offered THEN the system SHALL display contact information and estimated response time (24-48 hours)

### Requirement 4: Client Outreach & Contact

**User Story:** As an interested agricultural client, I want to easily initiate a professional dialogue, so that I can get a quote and start a project that addresses my farming technology needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor wants to make contact THEN the system SHALL provide a contact section accessible from main navigation and footer
2. WHEN a visitor submits a contact form THEN the system SHALL collect name (required), email (required with validation), company, project type, and message using Vapor's built-in form handling with robust spam protection (honeypot field and validation)
3. WHEN a visitor completes the form THEN the system SHALL display success message and expected response timeframe
4. IF the visitor prefers alternative contact THEN the system SHALL display professional email address and LinkedIn profile link

### Requirement 5: Performance & Accessibility

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the site to load quickly and work reliably, so that I can efficiently evaluate the developer's services without technical frustrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses any page THEN the system SHALL load within 3 seconds on 3G connections (1.6 Mbps) with initial page weight under 1MB using WebP image format and lazy loading optimization, achieving Google Lighthouse score of 90+ for both desktop and mobile
2. WHEN the site is deployed THEN the system SHALL leverage CDN for optimal performance and use progressive enhancement for core content accessibility without JavaScript
3. WHEN a visitor navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL use CSS transitions under 0.3 seconds duration
4. IF the visitor uses assistive technologies THEN the system SHALL include alt text for images, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support

### Requirement 6: SEO & Discoverability

**User Story:** As a search engine or social media platform, I want to properly index and display the website, so that potential clients can discover the developer's agricultural coding services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search engines crawl the site THEN the system SHALL include meta title, description, Open Graph tags, and schema.org structured data for each page
2. WHEN the site is shared on social media THEN the system SHALL display preview cards with site title, description, and featured image (1200x630px)
3. WHEN visitors search for terms like "agricultural software developer" THEN the system SHALL include relevant keywords in page content and meta tags with automated metadata generation using Vapor middleware
4. IF the site is accessed from external links THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent branding with favicon, touch icons, logo, color scheme, and typography across all pages
