## Project Overview

We're developing a comprehensive IoT sensor network solution for modern agricultural operations. This project will demonstrate our expertise in creating scalable, reliable sensor systems for real-time farm monitoring.

## Technology Stack

- **IoT Sensors**: Custom sensor nodes for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
- **LoRaWAN**: Long-range, low-power wireless communication
- **Python**: Backend data processing and analytics
- **Data Analytics**: Real-time insights and predictive modeling

## Expected Outcomes

- Real-time monitoring of critical farm parameters
- Reduced manual labor through automated data collection
- Improved crop yield through data-driven decision making
- Scalable solution for farms of all sizes

*This project is currently in development. Case study and detailed results will be available upon completion.*
